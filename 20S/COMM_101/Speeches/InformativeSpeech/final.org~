When people think of the issue of plastics in the oceans, many may imagine
 huge floating garbage islands. However, such islands do not actually exist. 
And yet, even though not visually obvious, the plastic pollution in the oceans poses a massive problem with global consequences. 
	
According to a BLANK study which took samples from 2007 to 2013, it is estimated
 that there are over 250,000 tons of plastics on the surface of the ocean. 
One of the most common plastics found in this study was foamed polystyrene, which 
is often used in packaging. The study also learned that most plastics seem to reside in ocean gyres,
gulfs, and closed bays. One thing that surprised those in the study was that although the Northern Hemisphere is known to have more
sources of ocean pollution, the amounts of pollution for the Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere were roughly the same. 
The study proposes that this could be explained by ocean currents and wind. What this means is that
not only is it hard to pinpoint the exact sources of pollution, but also how the solution to the 
plastics problem will require a global solution.

With all of this pollution, a good question to ask ourselves is where this pollution is coming from. 
One of the major sources of pollution is "land-based coastal pollution," which is estimated by BLANK study to be responsible for
over 80% of marine pollution. Of this pollution, 1% resides on the ocean surface, leaving 90% to rest on the ocean floor.
Considering that BLANK study estimated 250,000 tons on the surface of the ocean, one can estimate that the total
plastics polluting the marine world is of the order of 25,000,000 tons.

Although there is an astronomical amount of plastics in the oceans, the reason why there tend
to be no islands of garbage is due to the sunlight breaking down plastics into what scientists call microplastics.
According to Northeastern professor Aron Stubbins, microplastics or plastics smaller than 5 millimeters
are created from the sunlight breaking down plastics on the surface.

Although in some ways it is good that the sun does break down some plastics into microplastics, 
some marine life will inevitably mistake microplastics as food and will digest them. 
According to Gregory R. Murray from the University of Auckland, consumption of these materials
may cause starvation as the marine life cannot digest as well. However, according to Dr. Boris Jovanovi, who
has a PhD in "Toxicology and Fisheries Biology," the plastics consumed do not seem to build up
in fish over time. If that were the case, he argues, studies would have found greater amounts 
of plastic in older fish. Instead of seeing the plastics themselves as a problem, the doctor 
believes that the major concern should be the additives in the plastics and what affects that has
on marine life.
