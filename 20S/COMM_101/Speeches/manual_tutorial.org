* How to Drive a Manual


** Differences between automatic and manual car

1. Manuals have a clutch
2. Manuals require good knowledge of clutch and basic understanding of a car's engine


** Basics of clutch

1. The clutch is a pedal used to engage the engine of the car with the wheels
2. Under the hood, there is a disconnect between the engine and the wheels made by a clutch disc which when the clutch pedal is up is pressed against the wheels drive shaft.
3. If there is a great disconnect between the speed of the engine and the wheels, connecting them will cause either engine damage or a stall
   1. Like a Merry Go Round - You can't get on a fast spinning one unless you also are going roughly the same speed

      
** How to start a manual

1. Put it in first gear
2. Press clutch down
3. Turn on engine
4. Slowly release the clutch until you feel it start to catch
5. Start applying some gas and continue to release the clutch


** Common mistake

1. Release the clutch too quickly
   1. Stall the engine
   2. This is because you don't give the car enough time for the wheels to "catch up in speed" to the engine.
   3. In other words, you are connecting a running engine up to wheels that are either not moving, or moving too slow
