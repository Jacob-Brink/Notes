* The Relationship between the fourth gospel and the synoptics
** The Beginning of the Gospel (7)
- Unlike Matthew and Luke, John does not detail the following
  1. birth narrative
  2. virgin conception
  3. geneology
- John focuses on the idea of the Word in the beginning of the universe
  1. emphasizes divine character of God
  2. instead of being born, he has always existed since before time
** Difference of Style and Language
- John
  + life
  + light
  + darkness
  + true
  + world
  + Father
  + son
- Synoptic Gosepls
  + kingdom of god
  + repent
  + apostles
  + scribes
  + pharisees
  + tax collectors
** Chronological and Geographical Differences

*** Mentions of Passover
- John
  + 3 times
    - leads us to believe that Jesus' ministry spanned 3 years
  + Jesus spent more time in Judea than Galilee 
    - Synoptics
      + 1
      + Most of his time was in Galilee except for the one passover before his crucifixion
  + Last Meal Chronology
    + Synoptics
      * Last meal was during passover meal
    + John
      * Last meal is 24 hours before passover, which happens closer to his crucifixion and burial

*** Crucifixion and Passover
1. Synoptics show last supper as passover, while John does not make the connection
2. John's coinciding the passover with the crucifixion probably was a deliberate comparision between the passover lamb and Jesus
3. Climatic Event in Plot
   + Synoptics: Temple cleansing
   + John: Raising of Lazarus

*** Portrayal of Jesus
**** Unique Events in John
***** Excluded
     1. temptation in the wilderness
     2. Baptism of Jesus
     3. confession of Peter that Jesus is Messiah
     4. transfiguration
     5. struggle in garden of Gethsemane
     6. institution of last supper
     7. speech on cross
***** Included
     1. wedding at Cana
     2. Nicodemus conversation
     3. encounter with the woman in Samaria
     4. raising of Lazarus
     5. washing of the disciples' feet
**** Conclusion
1. Jesus is portrayed as a divine, heavenly being
2. Jesus is extrahuman
3. Jesus only speaks about his
   1. identity
   2. origin
   3. relation to Father
4. Differences
   + Wondrous Works
     1) Only synoptics includ exorcisms
     2) John shows Jesus healing longer sicknesses (patient suffered for more time of his life)
	+ Lazurus in John is completely definitely dead
	+ Girl in Matthew might have been just sleeping ("The girl is not dead but sleeping")
     3) John records much less wondrous works (j8)
   + Conclusion of Wondrous Works
     * Synoptic gospels use miracles to show Jesus' kingdom on earth
     * John uses miracles to identify Jesus as divine
**** Similarity 
1. Passion Story
   1. Same basic story between gospels
   2. Slight differences exist, but same plot
2. Speeches
3. Metaphors
   1. grain of wheet
   2. salt
   3. sowing

* Ways of Explaining Both Differences and Similarities in John
1. Author knew of Synoptic gospels and wrote supplementary gospel that emphasized the spritual side of Jesus
   1. Problems: doesn't explain why there would be seemingly contradictory timelines of passover
2. Author did not know of Synoptic gospels, and any similarities are explained by author's experiences coinciding with the synoptic gospels
3. The author used information from one of two branches of oral tradition, which at some points did crossover
