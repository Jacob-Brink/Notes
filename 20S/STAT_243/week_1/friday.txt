Bias in Sampling
- Selection bias
- Response bias
- Wording of questions
- survivorship bias (some cases are unavailable)
- observer bias (unconcious projection of expectations on participants or data)

Explanatory Response or Cause Effect

Variables may be
	  - association (when one changes, the other changes as well)
	    - other variable (lurking or confounding) associated with both and explains
	  - causation
	    
Types of Studies
      - Observational Study
      	* researchers do not control or assign values of any variable
	* may be many lurking variables
	* can't demonstrate causation
      - Experimental Study
      	* researchers do control values of variables of interest
	* ways of controlling variables
	  - randomizations (randomized experiment) (values of treatment variables assigned randomly)
	  - avoids lurking variables
	  - Matched pairs
	    * (each case is observed repeatedly, with all possible treatments) twin studies
	    * (cases are paired / grouped y important characteristics; on gets treatment
