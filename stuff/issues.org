* TODO Fix stop event not overwriting update stop event
** TODO Have two logs, one that is start and stop, the other is players online before crash
** TODO when server crashes, the server starting up on enable must look through players online before crash file
** TODO caveat: plugins are disabled before players leave, so it might look like a crash when it shouldn't be if i rely on playersquit event when server is shut down. Therefore, onDisable I need to check all online players and call stop on them.
** TODO crash_save.yml
*** TODO Contains the following
**** TODO Updated TimeStamp every X seconds
**** TODO List of Players active currently
*** TODO Methods
**** TODO onEnable(): Get All Players in file and recover stop data for them. && clear()
**** TODO onDisable(): clear()
**** TODO clear(): remove players from file
* STARTED Fix loading that erases data from yaml config
** STARTED [#A] believe it is that i run auto save and load in different threads. probably saving before loaded?
