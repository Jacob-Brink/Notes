When people think of the issue of plastics in the oceans, many may imagine  huge floating garbage islands. However, these islands do not actually exist. And yet, even though not visually obvious, the plastic pollution in the oceans poses a massive problem with global consequences. 
According to a study published in ProQuest which took samples of the ocean from 2007 to 2013, it is estimated  that there are over 250,000 tons of plastics on the surface of the ocean. One of the most common plastics found in this study was foamed polystyrene, which is often used in packaging. The study also learned that most plastics seem to reside in ocean gyres, gulfs, and closed bays. One thing that surprised those in the study was that although the Northern Hemisphere is known to have more sources of ocean pollution, the amounts of pollution for the Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere were roughly the same. The study proposes that this could be explained by ocean currents and wind (Eriksen, Marcus, et al.). What this means is that not only is it hard to pinpoint the exact sources of pollution, but also how the solution to the plastics problem will require a global solution.
With all of this pollution, a good question to ask ourselves is where this pollution is coming from. One of the major sources of pollution is "land-based coastal pollution," which is estimated by a study published in the Oxford Academic to be responsible for over 80% of marine pollution. Of this pollution, 1% resides on the ocean surface, leaving 90% to rest on the ocean floor (Bethanie Carney Almroth). Considering that the first mentioned study estimated 250,000 tons on the surface of the ocean, one could estimate that the total plastics polluting the marine world is of the order of 25,000,000 tons.
Although there is an astronomical amount of plastics in the oceans, the reason why there tend to be no islands of garbage is due to the sunlight breaking down plastics into what scientists call microplastics. According to Northeastern professor Aron Stubbins, microplastics or plastics smaller than 5 millimeters are created from the sunlight breaking down plastics on the surface of the ocean (“Nearly Eight Million Tons of Plastic Are Missing from Our Oceans. New Research Shines Some Light on What May Be Happening. - News @ Northeastern.”).
Although in some ways it is good that the sun does break down some plastics into microplastics, some marine life will inevitably mistake microplastics as food and will digest them. According to Gregory R. Murray from the University of Auckland, consumption of these materials may cause starvation as marine life cannot digest as well (Gregory, Murray R.). However, according to Dr. Boris Jovanovi, who has a PhD in "Toxicology and Fisheries Biology," the plastics consumed do not seem to build up in fish over time. If that were the case, he argues, studies would have found greater amounts of plastic in older fish. Instead of seeing the plastics themselves as a problem, the doctor believes that the major concern should be the additives in the plastics and what affects that has on marine life (Jovanović, B.).


In addition to plastics being consumed by marine life, humans will inevitably come across chemicals from plastics in their food. Even those who do not eat seafood can still be impacted by ocean pollution, since a significant amount of food livestock on land eat comes from fish. According to a study in The Royal Society Publishing, not only did they find chemicals used in plastics in humans, but they also note that these chemicals can negatively impact the endocrine system which is crucial for creating hormones in our bodies (Talsness Chris E.). From the other studies I encountered, there is simply not enough studies to understand the full extent of the impact of how chemicals in plastics can affect our health.
While there may be no islands of garbage in the ocean, the issue of so many tons of plastics polluting the oceans and the effects it has on marine life is a problem that needs more attention.
