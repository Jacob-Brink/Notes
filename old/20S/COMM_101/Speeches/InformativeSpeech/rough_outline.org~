* Plastic Pollution in Oceans

1. Amount of Plastics on ocean surface [[https://search.proquest.com/docview/1635009481/fulltextPDF/799F926C19BA4E88PQ/1?accountid=9844][Source]] (i think 2007-2013)
   1. "we estimate a minimum of 5.25 trillion particles weighing 268,940 tons" [[file:research.org::*%5B%5Bhttps://academic-oup-com.lib-proxy.calvin.edu/reep/article/13/2/317/5522920%5D%5BGood%20Overview%20But%20Also%20In%20Depth%5D%5D][Source]] sea surface
   2. "we stress that our estimates are highly conservative"
   3. Plastics are broken down and head toward ocean gyres or gulfs, closed bays, and seas
   4. Using net tows and visual survey transects sampling strategy, they estimated total amount of plastics
   5. In southern hemisphere, Indian Ocean has more than other oceans
   6. The 891 visual surveys revealed that foamed polystyrene items were the most frequently observed macroplastics
      1. Foamed Polystyrene items
	 1. package peanuts
	 2. packaging foam
   7. derelict fishing buoys accounted for most (58.3%) of the total macroplastic weight
   8. They found that even though there is more plastic pollution sources in the northern hemisphere, the two hemispheres are roughly the same in pollution
      1. "Our results confirm similar patterns for all southern hemisphere oceans. Surprisingly, the total amounts of plastics determined for the southern hemisphere oceans are within the same range as for the northern hemisphere oceans (Table 1), which is unexpected given that inputs are substantially higher in the northern than in the southern hemisphere"
      2. This may mean that ocean currents and wind can substantially move plastics around in ocean
   9. "35,500 metric tons"

2. Sources of Plastics
   1. [[https://academic-oup-com.lib-proxy.calvin.edu/reep/article/13/2/317/5522920][source]]

      - Land-based coastal pollution (responsible for 80% of marine pollution

	1. over 90% of plastics go to ocean floor

	2. 1% is on surface

	3. 5% on beaches

3. Types of Plastics in ocean
   1. Microplastics (<5mm)
      1. [[https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/08/07/nearly-eight-million-tons-of-plastic-are-missing-from-our-oceans-new-research-shines-some-light-on-what-may-be-happening/][Source]] Northeastern professor Aron Stubbins says "ultraviolet rays strike large pieces of plastic floating in the ocean and break them into [microplastics]"
	 1. Sun does biodegrade styrofoam, but not polyethylene plastics and plastics that sink to the ocean floor

   2. Types of Plastics common in marine environment [[https://academic-oup-com.lib-proxy.calvin.edu/reep/article/13/2/317/5522920][source]]

      1. Polypropylene

      2. Polyethylene

      3. polyvinylchloride

      4. polyurethane

      5. polyterephthalate

      6. polystyrene

4. Affects of Plastics in Oceans
   1. List of Problems With Ingestion
      1. "wounds (internal and external), suppurating skin lesions and ulcerating sores; blockage of digestive tract followed by satiation, starvation and general debilitation often leading to death; reduction in quality of life and reproductive capacity; drowning and limited predator avoidance; impairment of feeding capacity; and the possibility that plastic resin pellets may adsorb and concentrate potentially damaging toxic compounds from sea water" [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873013/][source]]

      2. Microplastics ingested do not accumulate in fish, which would be very serious [[https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ieam.1913][source]]
	 1. "Occurrence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract of fish is ephemeral, as otherwise larger and older fish would show ingestion of a higher number of particles, which is not the case"

      3. Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry suggest that while fish can ingest undigestable material, the main concern should be the additives in plastics not the basic plastic material itself.

   2. Ingesting microplastics may slow down consumption of food in fish (study of fish eating microplastics-ingesting zooplankton [[https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ieam.1913#ieam1913-bib-0010][Ingestion of microplastics by fish and its potential consequences from a physical perspective]]

   3. [[https://academic-oup-com.lib-proxy.calvin.edu/reep/article/13/2/317/5522920][source]]

      1. chemicals added to plastics are known to cause "endocrine disruption, developmental disorders, and reproductive abnormalities"

      2. Not enough research has been done on affects on humans' health
