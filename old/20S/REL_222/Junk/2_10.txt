* Gospel of John
** Unique Characteristics
*** Jesus as Word
*** More emphasis on trinity
** What is John?
*** Literature?
**** Jesus as Revealer

*** History?
**** Very and not very historical
***** Not Historical
****** geographical features
****** chronology of ministry and death of Jesus
****** John made Jesus speak more about his identity and messianic role than the synoptics did, which means synoptics were probably more accurate
****** John wrote speakings of Jesus similar to how Johannine epistles described Jesus' speaking
***** Historical
*** Theology
**** Background 
***** John was written during early Christian debate around differing confessions of whether Jesus was fully man
****** John asserts Jesus had "come in the flesh" (1 John 4:2)

******* "Logos incarnate" (17)
******* All knowing
******* obedient to Father
****** Stresses humanity of Jesus
******* gets tired
******* weeps
******* thirsts
**** Historical Context
***** John emphasizes Jesus' role in fulfilling Israel's history and the Hebrew Scriptures
***** no account of Lord's Supper, yet uses bread and water to symbolize "universal appeal" (
