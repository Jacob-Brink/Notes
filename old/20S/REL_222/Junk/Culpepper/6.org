*** Dialogue with Nicodemus (3:1-21)

**** Nicodemus
***** Description
****** Direct
******* a man of the pharisees
******* named Nicodemus "Conqueror of the People"
******* ruler of the Jews, probably member of Sanhedrin
****** Indirect
******* Since he came to Jesus at night, he may have wanted to keep his faith a secret
***** Dialogue
1. Nicodemus admits he and his friends believe Jesus is sent from God
2. Does not understand what to be born again means
3. Jesus explains difference of heaven and earth, saying that Nicodemus cannot understand heaven if he cannot understand the ways of the earth
4. (16-18) For God so loved the world
5. (19-21) Jesus explains how Jesus is the light and the world is darkness

**** John the Baptist's Testimony Continued (22-30)
***** John and Jesus baptize people unlike Synoptics
***** John's Testimony that Jesus is savior and lord not John
1. One can receive only what God has given
2. He had said that he was not the Messiah
3. He is not bridegroom but bridgegroom's friend
4. His joy is fulfilled
5. Jesus must increase while he decreases

**** Part of a Discourse on the Earthly and the Heavenly (31-36)
***** Doublet of versus 11-21

** Schneiders (117-122)

*** Who is Nicodemus?
**** Real or Metaphor? No one knows and shouldn't matter.
**** Represents Either
1. Jews who did not accept Jesus
2. Those with inadequate faith
3. Those who knew who Jesus was but would not dare share their faith in fear of opposition
4. Someone who is just innocently confused with Christianity
*** Jesus' Treatment of Nicodemus
**** While Jesus may seem to be making fun of Nicodemus saying that although he is a great teacher he doesn't understand the basics of the scriptures, Jesus actually goes on to explain to Nicodemus who he is.
*** Mentions of Nicodemus after John 3
**** 7:50-52
***** Nicodemus defends Jesus against the Sanhedrin
**** 19:39-42
***** Nicodemus buries Jesus
*** Purpose of Nicodemus
**** To encourage readers who know Jesus is the savior to act on their belief and to accept what they know to be true


*** Dialogue (3:2-10)
1. Jesus says that one must be born again (anew)
2. Nicodemus mistakenly interprets born again to mean born physically again
3. Jesus says to be born of water and spirit

*** Nicodemus Misunderstandings
1. Nicodemus misinterprets anew to mean again

*** Born of Water and Spirit
1. Water
   - Human birth of flesh from flesh
   - Also hearkens back to Old Testament purification that uses water to purify Israel in ceremonies
   - Possibly baptism?
2. Spirit

*** The wind blows...
1. The wind blows and people know it does - People know Christians are different and have been changed
2. No one knows the origin and destiny - People like Nicodemus do not understand how Christians have been born again

** Kysar (51-56, 71-84)
