* Fitting Distribution to Data
** Steps
1. Finding the mean OR expected value OR E(x) of a PDF
   1. Motivation: Computing averages
   2. Discrete Mean = Summation of (Value * Value's Probability)
   3. Continuous Mean = Integral of X*f(x)
   4. Variance = (Standard Deviation)^2
   5. Variance(x) = E((x-mew)^2) = E(x^2)-[E(x)]^2Do not use for calculation of variance
