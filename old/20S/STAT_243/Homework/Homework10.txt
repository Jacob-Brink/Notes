### Problem 4.45

a. 0.01
b. 0.30
c. 0.05

### Problem 4.52

a. The p-value of 0.0003 from Supplier A means it is unlikely to get their sample statistic (their measured average arsenic level from a sample) if the null hypothesis is true. The p-value of 0.3500 from Supplier B means it is reasonably likely to get the sample statistic Supplier B measured given the null hypothesis is true.
b. The lower p-value of 0.0003 from Supplier A shows stronger evidence for the alternative hypothesis, since it means that it is extremely unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true, which means you can reject the null hypothesis and therefore accept the alternative hypothesis. This p-value suggests that the mean arsenic level is above 80ppb.
c. Supplier B would be the better choice, since it is known that Supplier A has arsenic levels higher than 80ppb. Although it is unknown whether Supplier B does have arsenic levels higher or equal to 80ppb is unknown, since they failed to reject the null hypothesis. So, although you don't know the arsenic levels in relation to 80ppb for Supplier B, there is a chance unlike Supplier A that Supplier B has low levels.

### Problem 4.55 (On separate file)

### Problem 4.58

a. The null hypothesis hypothesis is that the proportion of people who die from colon cancer with polyps is equal to the proportion of people who die from colon cancer after having their polyp removed. The Alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of people who die from colon cancer after having their polyp removed is less than the proportion of people who die from colon cancer with polyps.
b. The sample proportion is 12/2602 (0.0046), which is the proportion of those with polyps removed that died of colon cancer. 
c. The p-value is probably 4/1000 (0.4%). Since the p-value is the proportion of cases that are as extreme or more extreme than the measured statistic, I counted all the dots to the left of the 0.0046 marker and by dividing by 1000, I get the p-value.

### Problem 4.105

a. If we are right in our conclusion, we rejected the null hypothesis and we were right to reject it. If we were wrong in our conclusion, we would have wrongly rejected the null hypothesis when it was actually true (Type I Error).
b. If we are right that our study showed no significant results, the null hypothesis was true and we correctly failed to reject it. If we are wrong, we commit a Type II error if the null hypothesis was false.
