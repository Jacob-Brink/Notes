* Probability Distribution
Function that tells how often you'd expect to see possible values at a random variable
** Types
1. Discrete
   - variable takes on discrete set of possible values
   - Finding the probability of what value you roll on a die
   - graph should tell you possible values for x and probability on y
2. Continuous
   - Plotted in terms of variable of possible values on x axis and "probability density" on y axis
     - the reason it is probability density and not probability is because with infinite values, a plot of probability would show a flat line on the y=0
   - Graphing
     - density plot
     - density histogram
     - (total area under curve must be 1 of a probability density graph)
