Five Programming Paradigms
	  Imperative (write blocks of statements, e.g. Fortran, Algol, Ada, BASIC, COBOL, c)
	  Functional (write functions, pass arguments, e.g. lisp family, ML, Haskell)
	  Object-oriented (build objects, send them messages, e.g. Smalltalk, Java, C++, Haskell, Ada)
	  Concurrent (building communicating processes/threads/tasks, e.g. CSP, Ocean, Java,Ada, Erlang, Scala, Chapel, Go, Julia)
	  Logic (write inference rules or a bunch of cases (prolog, ml))
	  
Specifying Syntax with BNF(Backus Naur Forms)s

Grammar & Syntax (specifies the word-sequence that form valid sentences)

Semantics (what a sentence means)

	  Context-sensitive (english)

Backus-Naur Form is a tool for specifying the syntax of a high level language (HLL)
Used by compilers to check syntax
     	    example:
		<identifier>	:: <first letter><valid sequence>
		<first_letter>	:: <letter>|_ (letter or underscore)
