* Block Structures
1. Smalltalk
   - Block construct is an object
   - <block-object> ::= [<params><locals><expr-list>]
   - <params>       ::= <param-list>...
   - Block not only has local variables but also parameters
     - [:i|i+1]value:2 --> 3
       - 2 goes into ":i" parameter
2. Lisp
   - expressions in "body" is executed sequentially by default
   - Last function's value is returned from body

* Selective Execution
1. If Statement
2. If Else
3. Multi-Branch Logic

* Dangling Else Problem

if Condition, then
    if Condition, then
        Stmt
else (what if statement does this else apply to?)
    Stmt

This requires an additional set of rules called "semantic rules" to remove grammar ambiguity.
